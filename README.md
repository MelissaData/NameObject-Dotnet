# Melissa Data Name Object Windows Example

## Purpose

This is an example of the Melissa Data Name Object using C#

The console will ask the user for:

- Full Name (First Name + Last Name)

And return 

- First Name
- Middle Name
- Last Name
- Gender
- Salutation
- ResultCodes

----------------------------------------

## Tested Environments

- Windows 64-bit .NET Core 3.1
- Powershell 5.1
- Melissa data files for 2022-07

----------------------------------------

## Required Files and Programs

### mdName.dll*

This is the c++ version of the Melissa Data Object.

### mdNameNET.dll*

This file needs to be added as a Project Dependency.  This wrapper will need to be in the same directory as the program using it.

(*) These files will be downloaded by Melissa Updater!

### Data Files

- mdName.cfg
- mdName.dat
 
----------------------------------------

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

#### Install the Dotnet Core SDK
Before starting, make sure that the .NET Core 3.1 SDK has been correctly installed on your machine (If you have Visual Studio installed, you most likely have it already). If you are unsure, you can check by opening a command prompt window and typing the following:

`dotnet --list-sdks`

If the .NET Core 3.1 SDK is already installed, you should see it in the following list:

As long as the above list contains version `3.1.xxx` (underlined in red), then you can skip to the next step. If your list does not contain version 3.1, or you get any kind of error message, then you will need to download and install the .NET Core 3.1 SDK from the Microsoft website.

To download, follow this link: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download

On the webpage, make sure you click the button that says `Download .NET Core SDK x64`:

(IMPORTANT: Make sure you download the SDK, NOT the runtime. the SDK contains both the runtime as well as the tools needed to build the project.)

Once clicked, your web browser will begin downloading an installer for the SDK. Run the installer and follow all of the prompts to complete the installation (your computer may ask you to restart before you can continue). Once all of that is done, you should be able to verify that the SDK is installed with the `dotnet --list-sdks` command.

----------------------------------------

#### Set up Powershell settings

If running Powershell for the first time, you will need to run this command in the Powershell console: `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`.
The console will then prompt you with the following warning shown in the image below. 
 - Enter `'A'`. 
 	- If successful, the console will not output any messages. (You may need to run Powershell as administrator to enforce this setting).

----------------------------------------

#### Download this project
```
$ git clone https://github.com/MelissaData/NameObject-Dotnet.git
$ cd NameObject-Dotnet
```

----------------------------------------

#### Set up Melissa Updater 

Melissa Updater is a CLI application allowing the user to update their Melissa applications/data.

- Download Melissa Updater here: <https://releases.melissadata.net/Download/Library/WINDOWS/NET/ANY/latest/MelissaUpdater.exe>

- Create a folder within the cloned repo called `MelissaUpdater`
- Put `MelissaUpdater.exe` in `MelissaUpdater` folder you just created

----------------------------------------

#### Different ways to get data files
1.  Using Melissa Updater
	- It will handle all of the data download/path and dlls for you. 
2.  If you already have the latest DQS Release (ZIP), you can find the data files and dlls in there
	- Use the location of where you copied/installed the data and update the "$DataPath" variable in the powershell script 
	- Copy all the dlls mentioned above into the `MelissaDataNameObjectWindowsNETExample` project folder

----------------------------------------

## Run Powershell Script

Parameters:
- -name (optional): a test name
 	
  This is convenient when you want to get results for a specific name in one run instead of testing multiple names in interactive mode.  
- -license (optional): your license string
- -quiet (optional): add to the command if you do not want to get any console output from the Melissa Updater

When you have modified the script to match your data location, let's run the script. 

There are two modes:

- Interactive 

	The script will prompt the user for a name, then use the provided name to test Name object. For example:
	```
	$ .\MelissaDataNameObjectWindowsNETExample.ps1
	```
    For quiet mode:
    ```
    $ .\MelissaDataNameObjectWindowsNETExample.ps1 -quiet
    ```
- Command Line 

	You can pass a name in ```-name``` parameter and a license string in ```-license``` parameter to test Name object. For example:
	```
    $ .\MelissaDataNameObjectWindowsNETExample.ps1 -name "Ray Melissa"
    $ .\MelissaDataNameObjectWindowsNETExample.ps1 -name "Ray Melissa" -license "<your_license_string>"
    ```
	For quiet mode:
    ```
    $ .\MelissaDataNameObjectWindowsNETExample.ps1 -name "Ray Melissa" -quiet
    $ .\MelissaDataNameObjectWindowsNETExample.ps1 -name "Ray Melissa" -license "<your_license_string>" -quiet
    ```
	
This is the expected output from a successful setup for interactive mode:
